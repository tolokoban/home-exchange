                        If you like to walk, but don't want to go far, then the
                        SalÃ¨ve is a good choice.
                        <br />I use to run a lot in this mountain: there are a
                        lot of trails. The side you see from the house is
                        covered in forest, but the other side has more cliffs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are adventurous, you can reach the summit from
                        home by feet. It will take about two hours and there is
                        7 km and 700 D+ (4.3 mi and 2200 feet elevation).

                        But you can also reach the top by car in 10 minutes and
                        start walking from there. it will be mostly flat (as
                        flat as the top of a mountain can be, of course ðŸ˜„), and
                        you will have the view of the Mont-Blanc on one side and
                        the view on the lake on the other side.

                        There is a Buddhist monastery that also serves food (

                        ). You can attend the prayers on sunday morning at 10
                        AM.

                        <br />I like to go there when I run. I just stay outside
                        and listen to the chanted prayers (there is a
                        loudspeaker for those who are too shy to enter ðŸ˜‰).
